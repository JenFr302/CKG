                            Enemies are aggressive creatures that attempt to damage the player.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Most enemies spawn naturally over time on specific spawning tiles. Other creatures spawn with the initial generation of an area and do not respawn. See creature and object spawning for details on how the game spawns enemies.

                        <p>
                            There are a total of 67 enemies in the game, 20 of which are bosses.

                    <p>
                        Each boss has its own particular method of being summoned. Some bosses are found naturally in the world, whereas others are summoned by placing their boss-summoning item in a specific area.

                        All bosses reward the player with various randomized loot, such as armor, accessories, weapons and materials. Bosses typically require many re-fights in order to obtain all of their drops.

                    <p>

                                The Core Commander can be summoned for the first time by interacting with and shattering the Crystal Meteor after obtaining all six boss souls.

                                Once defeated, they can be re-summoned by placing a Core Commander Summoning Idol on the rune inside the meteor.

                            Boss-summoning items are items used to spawn a boss. They are consumed on a successful use.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Most boss-summoning items are furniture and summon their boss when placed in a specific area. The only exceptions are the Expert Lure (a type of bait) and the Primeval Slime Cell (a consumable).
