                <p>The world is where all of Core Keeper's gameplay takes place.</p>
                <p>Each world is procedurally generated, but the structure always starts with the Core at the center and increasingly dangerous regions radiating outward. As you dig away from the starting cavern, the environment shifts into distinct biomes with unique tiles, lighting, resources, enemies, and hazards.</p>
                <p>Mixed into this random layout are handcrafted “scenes” such as ruins, dungeons, villages, and special structures that feel like designed set pieces. These areas often contain lore hints, rare loot, or boss arenas and help the cave system feel more alive than a purely random tunnel network.</p>

                                <strong id="the-world-core">The World Core</strong> is a major structure in Core Keeper. It is one of, if not the most important structure in the entire game, and as such also serves as the game's icon.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Core is located in the very center of each world and is where all players start the game. In the beginning, it will be in a state of disrepair and must be fixed by the player by defeating the three mandatory bosses - Glurch the Abominous Mass, Ghorm the Devourer, and Malugaz the Corrupted.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Interacting with the Core before it is activated will do nothing and make a failure sound.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Symbols of The Core can be found all across the world of Core Keeper. Not much is known about it currently, and there appears to be a lot of mystery around its purpose and existence, but several locations, items, and tools seem to imply that it may have been revered by the once-thriving civilization located throughout the underground world.

As the player moves away from The Core, it will become apparent that this area is index to the Orange and Red Slime Enemies, causing some parts of the biome to be covered in Orange Ground Slime. The Slime sub-biome that contains Glurch the Abominous Mass may be found at a certain point in a random direction from The Core.
